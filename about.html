                        <p class="about-body">Water Relief Africa started in 2018, though we have other organisations that provide succour for the water needs of humanity around the world, there are far more places to reach out to especially in Africa.

        <p class="about-headers">Why Water Relief Africa?</p> 
        <p class="about-body">
                It’s no secret that Africa has a water problem. People in developed countries have known this for a long time, and organizations and governments around the world have been trying to make a difference for decades. Unfortunately, the continent of Africa continues to face a big problem, and it only seems to be getting worse no matter how hard people try to resolve it.
                <br><br>The biggest issue is the inability to find fresh, clean water for drinking and daily living. Most people in Africa rely on surface water and don’t have the technology or the money to dig wells to harvest groundwater. Since Africa is an arid continent, surface water evaporates often, and when that’s coupled with the strain placed on these bodies of water by large populations, the result is a receding water table across the continent.
                <br><br>Sanitation also poses a big problem. Many people don’t have dedicated sewage or septic systems, so human waste builds up over time and pollutes the surface water used for drinking. Even in agricultural processes, animal waste can’t be disposed of properly, leading to unsanitary conditions that are perfect for the spread of disease. There are a lot of factors that work together to cause problems for the condition of water across Africa, and these don’t seem to be easing up anytime soon.
